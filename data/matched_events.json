Hackathon - The Innovation Round. The Jeopardy Round will have 5-10 Questions per team that will be divided into 5 levels of difficulties ranging from very easy to very challenging. Right answers will gain the teams MozCoins depending on the level of difficulty of the question and an appropriate MozCoins deduction will be made for every wrong answer as well. Once the Jeopardy round is over we will move into the Scotland Yard round which will have multiple lobbies and each lobby will have 6 teams. 5 detective teams and 1 Mr.X (Imposter) team. The imposter's location will be revealed every 5 moves and based on that the detectives are supposed to track Mr.X. Based on how close each detective is to Mr.X , they get some amount of MozCoins and the same goes for Mr.X. Mr.X gains MozCoins for how far away from the detectives he is. The detectives and Mr.X also have the opportunity to spend points in round 2. Detectives can use MozCoins to know the location of Mr.X at any move and Mr.X can use MozCoins to warp to some preset location if he knows the detectives are close. The showpiece round is the hackathon which will be a unique take on hackathons. The teams will have randomised problem statements. They can change their problem statement to some other random problem statement by spending MozCoins. Other than this there will be several ways to spend MozCoins in the hackathon like mentorship and time extensions.

A team's final victory is calculated with the hackathon project heavily weighted at 80% of the score, while their leftover MozCoins account for the remaining 20%.",
