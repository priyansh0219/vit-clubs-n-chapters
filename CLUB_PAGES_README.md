# Club Pages Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds individual pages for each club and chapter, making every club card clickable and linking to detailed pages. The solution is designed to work with Next.js static exports.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dynamic Routing Structure
- **Route**: `/club/[slug]` 
- **Location**: `src/app/club/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Each club gets its own URL based on a slugified version of its name

### 2. Slug Generation
- **Utility**: `src/lib/slug-utils.ts`
- Converts club names to URL-friendly slugs
- Examples:
  - "THE PHOTOGRAPHY CLUB" → `/club/the-photography-club`
  - "VIT FILM SOCIETY (VFS)" → `/club/vit-film-society-vfs`
  - "IEEE - COMSOC" → `/club/ieee-comsoc`

### 3. Static Generation
- Uses `generateStaticParams()` to pre-generate all 161 club pages at build time
- Compatible with Next.js static exports (`output: "export"`)
- All pages are generated during build, no runtime server required

### 4. Club Card Enhancements
- **File**: `src/components/clubs/club-card.tsx`
- Entire card is now wrapped in a Next.js `Link` component
- Added hover effects and "View Details" indicator
- Social media links prevent event bubbling to avoid navigation conflicts
- Added ring effect on hover to indicate clickability

### 5. Club Detail Page
- **Component**: `src/components/club-detail/club-detail-page.tsx`
- Comprehensive layout with:
  - Hero section with club image and basic info
  - Category badges and type indicators
  - Social media links (if available)
  - Full description
  - Share functionality (native or clipboard fallback)
  - Navigation back to main page
  - Contact information section

### 6. Error Handling
- Custom 404 page for non-existent clubs
- **File**: `src/app/club/[slug]/not-found.tsx`
- Maintains design consistency with main site

### 7. SEO & Metadata
- Dynamic metadata generation for each club page
- Open Graph support for social sharing
- Proper page titles and descriptions

## Features

### Interactive Elements
- **Clickable Cards**: Entire club cards are clickable with hover effects
- **Social Links**: Function independently without triggering navigation
- **Share Button**: Native share API with clipboard fallback
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

### Static Export Compatibility
- All pages are pre-generated at build time
- No server-side rendering required
- Works with static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
- Fast loading times and good SEO

### Visual Enhancements
- Subtle "View Details" indicator appears on hover
- Ring effect around cards when hovered
- Consistent design language with main site
- Dark mode support throughout

## Usage

### For Users
1. Browse clubs on the main page
2. Hover over any club card to see the "View Details" indicator
3. Click anywhere on the card to visit the club's individual page
4. Use social media links directly from cards or detail pages
5. Share club pages using the share button

### For Development
1. Club data is automatically loaded from `data/data.json`
2. All 161+ pages are generated at build time
3. Add new clubs to the JSON file and they'll automatically get pages
4. Slugs are generated automatically from club names
5. No additional configuration needed
